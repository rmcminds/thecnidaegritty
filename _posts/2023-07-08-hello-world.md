I'm creating this site using GitHub pages and Jekyll for the first time! This is a 'hello world' blog post<!--more-->, soon to be followed by some material from the [Multilingual Journal Club](https://github.com/McMinds-Lab/multilingual_journal_club) that aims to explain some papers we're reading in languages other than English. Who knows how else I'll use the site in the future... but I've also got the Wordle-inspired [iNatle](/iNatle/) as a page here, and I've got plans to make it more fun and more stable.
